## Hi...My name is **Jeffrey Lin** from Taipei, TaiwanðŸ˜Š.

##### I recently graduated with my Master of Public Health degree in Infectious Disease Epidemiology from Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University. Prior to entering my Master program, I had an honor to serve as an emergency medical technician for six months for conscription in Taiwan. I gained significant training in emergency responses and communications.

##### My interest in epidemiology was sparked during my junior year of college, at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the world grappled with a global health crisis, I became fascinated by how infectious diseases spread and how public health strategies could mitigate their impact. This curiosity led me to immerse myself in a diverse range of microbiology and epidemiology courses, which not only deepened my understanding of disease patterns but also ignited a passion for applying these concepts to real-world challenges. I further honed my epidemiologic skills through a research project that examined the mental health experiences of college students, where I gained firsthand experience in data collection and analysis. As an international student studying Biology with a focus on infectious diseases and health determinants, I recognized the importance of additional epidemiological training in addressing complex health issues across populations. This academic journey solidified my commitment to pursuing epidemiology as a career.
